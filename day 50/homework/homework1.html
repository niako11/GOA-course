        <p>ფიფქია (გერმ. Schneewittchen) — გერმანული ზღაპარი, რომელიც ძმებმა გრიმებმა 1812 წელს გამოსცეს. სიუჟეტის მიხედვით, პრინცესა სახელად „ფიფქია“ ბოროტი დედინაცვლის გამო იძულებულია ტყეში დაიმალოს. იქ ის შვიდი ჯუჯის სახლს შეეფარება. ჯუჯები ყველანაირად უფრთხილდებიან ფიფქიას, მაგრამ ერთ დღეს მოხუცად ქცეული დედინაცვალი ფიფქიას მოუტანს მოწამლულ ვაშლს. ფიფქია კვდება, მაგრამ მას აცოცხლებს უფლისწულის კოცნა.</p>

        <p>asmine[1][2] is a fictional character who appears in Walt Disney Pictures' animated film Aladdin (1992). Voiced by Linda Larkin – with a singing voice provided by Lea Salonga – Jasmine is the spirited daughter of the Sultan, who has grown weary of her life of palace confinement. Despite an age-old law stipulating that the princess must marry a prince in time for her upcoming birthday, Jasmine is instead determined to marry someone she loves for who he is as opposed to what he owns. Created by screenwriters and directors Ron Clements and John Musker with co-screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, Jasmine is based on Badroulbadour, a princess who appears in the One Thousand and One Nights folktale "Aladdin and the Magical Lamp."

Originally conceived as a spoiled and materialistic princess, the writers eventually rewrote Jasmine into a stronger and more prominent heroine following the elimination of Aladdin's mother from the script, while borrowing story elements from the romantic comedy Roman Holiday (1953). Several months after securing the role, Larkin was nearly fired from the project because Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg felt that her voice was not suitable for a princess, but Clements and Musker managed to convince him otherwise. Discovered by casting director Albert Tavares, Lea Salonga was cast as Jasmine's singing voice based on her performance in the musical Miss Saigon; this unprecedented casting decision made Jasmine the first Disney Princess to have her speaking and singing voices provided by two different actresses. Animated by Mark Henn, Jasmine's design is an eclectic combination of unique sources, including an anonymous theme park guest, Henn's own sister, and actress Jennifer Connelly.

The character has garnered mixed reviews, with much of her character arc compared unfavorably to her predecessors Ariel from The Little Mermaid (1989) and Belle from Beauty and the Beast (1991), but has been praised for her personality and her chemistry with Aladdin. She is the sixth Disney Princess and the franchise's first non-European member, as well as its first West Asian princess.[3] Due to this, the character is credited with introducing racial diversity to Disney's princess genre. Unlike most of Disney's princesses, Jasmine is a supporting character in her own film, taking the secondary role of the love interest. Jasmine has made subsequent appearances in Aladdin's sequels The Return of Jafar (1994) and Aladdin and the King of Thieves (1996), as well as its television series and a Broadway musical adaption of the film. Both Larkin and Salonga have been awarded Disney Legends for their contributions to</p>

<p>Tiana Rogers[1] is a fictional character in Walt Disney Pictures' animated film The Princess and the Frog (2009). Created by writers and directors Ron Clements and John Musker and animated by Mark Henn, Tiana is voiced by Anika Noni Rose, with Elizabeth M. Dampier voicing the character as a child.

She is loosely based on two princesses: Princess Emma from the 2002 novel The Frog Princess by E. D. Baker, and the princess from the Brothers Grimm fairy tale "The Frog Prince". The character also was inspired by famed New Orleans chef Leah Chase.

A hardworking waitress who dreams of opening her own restaurant, Tiana finds her ambitions stalled when she kisses a prince who has been turned into a frog by an evil witch doctor, only to transform into one herself.

Tiana has been mostly positively received with critics praising her personality and values. However, the depiction of Tiana and her community has been criticized for lacking "emphasis on racial issues".[2] The decision to depict the two main characters, Tiana and Naveen, as frogs for the majority of the film has also caused controversy, with some saying that it downplays the characters' identities.[3] She is the ninth character added to the Disney Princess franchise, and is known for being the first African American member in the franchise. She is also the most modern princess in the lineup, as her story takes place in 1920’s New Orleans.</p>
